      "game generally known as \"One Old Cat\" became popular with schoolboys in the\n",

      "base and back without being put out. Two Old Cat, Three Old Cat, and Four\n",
      "Old Cat were modifications of this game, having respectively four, six, and\n",
      "eight players. A development of this game bore the name of town-ball and\n",
      "the Olympic Town-Ball Club of Philadelphia was organized in 1833. Matches\n",
      "between organized base-ball clubs were first played in the neighbourhood of\n",
      "New York, where the Washington Baseball Club was founded in 1843. The first\n",
      "regular code of rules was drawn up in 1845 by the Knickerbocker Baseball\n",
      "Club and used in its matches with the Gotham Eagle and Empire clubs of New\n",
      "York, and the Excelsior, Putnam, Atlantic and Eckford clubs of Brooklyn. In\n",
      "1858 the first National Association was organized, and, while its few\n",

      "present code, the ball was larger and \"livelier,\" and the pitcher was\n",
      "compelled to deliver it with a full toss, no approach to a throw being\n",

      "organizations were represented. While the work done at the convention did\n",
      "not accomplish all that was expected, it did produce certain reforms, and\n",

      "devised a scheme for playing it. About the beginning of the 19th century a\n",
      "game generally known as \"One Old Cat\" became popular with schoolboys in the\n",
      "North Atlantic states; this game was played by three boys, each fielding\n",
      "and batting in turn, a run being scored by the batsman running to a single\n",
      "base and back without being put out. Two Old Cat, Three Old Cat, and Four\n",
      "Old Cat were modifications of this game, having respectively four, six, and\n",
      "eight players. A development of this game bore the name of town-ball and\n",
      "the Olympic Town-Ball Club of Philadelphia was organized in 1833. Matches\n",
      "between organized base-ball clubs were first played in the neighbourhood of\n",
      "New York, where the Washington Baseball Club was founded in 1843. The first\n",
      "regular code of rules was drawn up in 1845 by the Knickerbocker Baseball\n",
